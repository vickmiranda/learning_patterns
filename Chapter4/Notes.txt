The principle of least knowledge. As you have learned in the initial parts of the
chapter, the Façade provides a unified system that makes subsystems easy to use.
It also decouples the client from the subsystem of components. The design
principle that is employed behind the Façade pattern is the principle of least
knowledge.

The principle of least knowledge guides us to reduce the interactions between
objects to just a few friends that are close enough to you. In real terms, it
means the following:When designing a system, for every object created, one
should look at the number of classes that it interacts with and the way in which
the interaction happens.Following the principle, make sure that we avoid
situations where there are many classes created that are tightly coupled to each
other.If there are a lot of dependencies between classes, the system becomes
hard to maintain. Any changes in one part of the system can lead to
unintentional changes to other parts of the system, which means that the system
is exposed to regressions and this should be avoided.
